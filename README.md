# Brick-Breaker
Brick Breaker is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen, bouncing a ball to break bricks arranged at the top. The goal is to clear all the bricks on the screen while keeping the ball in play using the paddle. If the player misses the ball with the paddle and it falls below the paddle, they lose a life.
